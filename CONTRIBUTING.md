# Contributing

## Branch strategy
- `main` is always deployable.
- Use short-lived feature branches: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`.

## Local setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. `npm run build`

## Commit style
Use clear, task-oriented messages.
Examples:
- `feat(hero): enlarge logo and refine entrance motion`
- `fix(ci): stabilize pages build on github actions`
- `docs(readme): add deployment and roadmap sections`

## Pull requests
- Keep PR focused and small.
- Include screenshots for UI changes.
- Link related issue if available.
